# Parking Lot System

## Overview
The Parking Lot System is an object-oriented parking management solution implemented in C++. It supports multiple floors, different vehicle types, and operations like parking, removing, and querying available spots. The system is designed for concurrency safety using spinlocks.

## Running the Project

### Compilation and Execution
To compile and run the project, use the following commands:

#### Windows (Using MinGW)
```sh
g++ main.cpp -o a.exe
./a.exe
```

#### Linux/macOS
```sh
g++ main.cpp -o a.out
./a.out
```

### Interfaces (Located in `include/interface/`)
- **IVehicle.h**: Abstract interface for different vehicle types.
- **IVehicleFactory.h**: Interface for vehicle factory logic.
- **IParkingSpot.h**: Interface for parking spots.
- **IParkingLot.h**: Defines core functionalities of the parking lot.
- **IParkingFloor.h**: Interface for parking floor management.

### Concrete Implementations (Located in `src/`)
- **VehicleFactory.h**: Factory pattern implementation for vehicle creation.
- **ParkingFloor.h**: Manages parking floors.
- **ParkingLot.h**: Implements the parking lot logic.
- **ParkingSpot.h**: Handles parking spot operations.
- **Bike.h, Car.h, Truck.h**: Implementations for different vehicle types.

## User Interaction
Users must interact with the system via the terminal. The available options are:
```cpp
cout << "\n========== PARKING LOT SYSTEM ==========\n";
cout << "Press 1 to park a vehicle" << endl;
cout << "Press 2 to remove a vehicle" << endl;
cout << "Press 3 to get vehicle location" << endl;
cout << "Press 4 to show available spots per floor" << endl;
cout << "Press 5 to check if parking lot is full" << endl;
cout << "Press 6 to exit" << endl;
cout << "Enter your choice: ";
```
